# datalog_par
a datalog implementation thats standard complient and fast.

the goal is to try and see if its possible to make an effishent engine for this languge. the target computer is 32+ cores and this matters becuase some algorithems actually benifit from spliting diffrently when you have 2-4 cores.

in terms of the parser it seems to be complient.

# TODO
1. add example programs
2. figure out a better way to name files
3. write a proper compile step
